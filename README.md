# Blackhole
Space ship battle royale built and a realtime GPU pathtracing game engine

## Hardware Support
Currently the GPU pathtracer requires a Vulkan capable GPU but Metal and DX12 will be supported in the future.

The pathtracer will not work if the GPU does not support STORAGE usage for swapchain images (see issue #7).
